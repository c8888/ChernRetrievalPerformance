      * All wave functions implemented here should take an ElementaryCell2D argument and return this table with wave function values in all its points.
      * Support is a table with which we multiply the wave function to get its final space distribution. Support is constructed in "Space2D.m"
      * Each wave function should have periodic boundary conditions!
